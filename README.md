Welcome to the Blog Website project! This is a full-stack web application built with React, MongoDB, Express, and Node.js. The project is divided into two main parts: the API and the client-side application.

Overview:
This project aims to provide a platform for users to create and share blog posts. Users can register an account, log in, create new posts, view existing posts, and edit their own posts.

  Features:
- User Authentication: Users can register an account and log in to access the full functionality of the website.
- Create and Edit Posts: Authenticated users can create new blog posts and edit their existing posts.
- View Posts: Users can view all posts available on the platform, including the ones created by other users.
- Edit Posts: Authenticated users can edit their own posts.

    Installation:
-Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/fifki/MyBlogWebsite.git
-Install dependencies for both the API and the client-side application:
bcryptjs - browserify-zlib - cookie-parser - cookie - cors - date-fns - jsonwebtoken - localforage - match-sorter- mongodb

  Repository Structure:
- api: This directory contains the server-side code for the API built with Express.js. It handles authentication, database interactions, and serves as the backend for the client-side application.
